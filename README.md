# Punchy Puppets
Punchy Puppets is a game made for the GMTK Game Jam: [See On Itch.io](https://finite-reflection.itch.io/punchy-puppets)

We wanted to make the source code publically available as a learning material for others, however we needed to remove two items to be allowed to legally post this.
Unfortunately, this means you will be unable to run this project until those compile-time errors are resolved.

## 1. ReWired
ReWired is used to handle our input, and is one of the best Unity packages out there for cross platform input handling.
[Buy it here](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/rewired-21676)

## 2. TextMesh Pro
This package is now included within latest versions of Unity and is technically free, but it made me nervous to include in a public repository so I removed it just to be safe.
You can download and add it to the project [here](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/beta-projects/textmesh-pro-84126)

# I hope this is educational and insightful to our game development process!
